# How to Google like a Pro

Master advanced search operators (`site:`, `filetype:`, `-`, `"exact match"`, etc.). Use Google Dorks for deep queries. Bookmark Google Scholar and Google Trends for research and insights.

## Additional Tips:

* **Use `inurl:` and `intitle:`** to filter by URL or page title content (e.g., `inurl:login` or `intitle:index.of`).
* **Leverage `define:`** to quickly get word definitions (e.g., `define:epistemology`).
* **Time filtering**: Use the "Tools" menu below the search bar to filter by time (past hour, day, week, etc.).
* **Use `cache:`** to view the cached version of a page (e.g., `cache:example.com`).
* **Search by image**: Right-click an image and use Google Lens, or go to [images.google.com](https://images.google.com) and upload an image to search visually.
* **Use `related:`** to find sites similar to a known one (e.g., `related:nytimes.com`).
* **Exclude results with `-`**: Add `-term` to exclude terms (e.g., `jaguar -car -feline`).
* **Search specific file types**: e.g., `site:.edu filetype:pdf "machine learning"` to find academic papers.
* **Explore "People Also Ask" and related searches**: These often surface useful long-tail queries.
* **Use quotes for exact phrases**: e.g., `"best practices in UX design"`.
* **Advanced search page**: [https://www.google.com/advanced\_search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) lets you set parameters manually.

### Specialized Tools:

* **Google Dataset Search**: [https://datasetsearch.research.google.com](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)
* **Google Public Data Explorer**: [https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
* **Google Books**: for full-text book search and previews.
* **Google Patents**: [https://patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com) for patent research.

## Habits of Power Users:

* Use keyboard shortcuts: `/` to jump to the search box.
* Learn the URL structure: e.g., manually append `&tbs=qdr:d` to search results URL to get only results from the past day.
* Combine operators logically: `("machine learning" OR "deep learning") site:arxiv.org filetype:pdf`
